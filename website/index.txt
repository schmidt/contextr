h2. What

ContextR is a library supporting "context-oriented programming
(COP)":http://www.swa.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/cop/.

h3. Version 1.0.1

This version includes the latest changes, that were introduced when finishing
the thesis. Nothing, that changes the usage, performance or API, just minor
refactorings inside the library.

h3. Version 1.0.0

Along with my Master's thesis ending and my lightning talk at "euruko
2008":http://www.euruko2008.org, the first stable release of ContextR will be
published. To reflect its status the version number reaches *1.0*. You may find
documentation and examples in the @test@ directory or "on in your Browser on
this website":test/introduction.html.

<div class="older_versions">

h3. Version 0.1.9

This is a review release. Again, lots of things changed, but I think to the
better. There will be more coverage with the 0.2.0. Until then, have a look at
the shiny new online "documentation":test/introduction.html

h3. Version 0.1.1

In this release we have added code examples, that also act as tests. See "this
blog article":http://www.contextr.org/2007/9/13/executable-code-in-usage-examples
for more information. This brought vast feature coverage with test.

An RSpec was added to allow even more test coverage.

@Object#extend@ allows definition of class side context dependent behaviour.

There have been minor changes to the reflection API. To fetch the currently
active layers use @ContextR::active_layers@ and you will get an array of symbols
representing them. @ContextR::layers@ gives all already defined layers, but they
are not necessarily active or have been.


h3. Version 0.1.0

This is the first release of ContextR after the 0.0.3 release. Since then a
full redesign took place. The API changed entirely so make sure to not use
this release with older code.

We think, that the new API is more powerful and allows better code to be written
with ContextR. Unfortunately it has some issues as well, but we consider them
as less relevant than the other way around. If you have any problems or question
concerning these changes, feel free to use the new
"mailing list":http://groups.google.com/group/contextr - any hint is appreciated

h2. Installing

<pre syntax="ruby">sudo gem install contextr</pre>

h2. The basics

In your code use

<pre syntax="ruby">require 'rubygems'
require 'contextr'</pre>

and ContextR will be ready to use. ContextR should work on Ruby 1.8 and JRuby.

h2. Prerequisites

*To get ContextR running, you won't need anything but @rubygems@ and the
@contextr@ gem*

To run all *tests* and *documentation* generation you will need the following
gems:

 * @rake@
 * @hoe@
 * @rspec@
 * @maruku@
 * @markaby@
 * @literate_maruku@

h2. Demonstration of usage

If context-oriented programming does not fit your needs to handle your
cross-cutting concerns, have a look at aspect-oriented programming. There is a
feature rich implementation for Ruby named
"aquarium":http://aquarium.rubyforge.org. Alternatively you may find interest
in feature-oriented programming. If all that does not help, feel free to drop
me a note and tell me, what you are trying to achieve.
