One of the most powerful features of Ruby is the concept of open classes. At
everytime, the programmer is able to change class, instances and methods. 
This has immediate effects on all instances and works like a charm.

One of the goals of ContextR 0.1.0 was to bring this power to the 
context-oriented abstraction. The following examples will simply demonstrate,
that it works. Not more, not less.

    class TrafficLight
      def initialize
        @state = 0
      end

      def state_ordering
        @state_ordering ||= [:red, :yellow, :green, :yellow]
      end

      def current
        state_ordering[@state]
      end

      def next
        @state += 1
        @state = 0 if @state >= state_ordering.size
        current
      end

      def red
        current == :red
      end
      def yellow 
        current == :yellow
      end
      def green
        current == :green
      end
      
      def text
        current.to_s
      end
    end

Here we have a simple dutch traffic light. Let's test if it works.

    $traffic_light = TrafficLight.new
    example do
      # It is always a good idea, to start with red
      result_of($traffic_light.red) == true 

      $traffic_light.next
      result_of($traffic_light.yellow) == true 

      $traffic_light.next
      result_of($traffic_light.green) == true 

      $traffic_light.next
      result_of($traffic_light.yellow) == true

      $traffic_light.next
      result_of($traffic_light.red) == true
    end

But in Germany the lights work different. The sequence looks like the 
following
  red
  red and yellow
  green
  yellow
  red

Let's build it with in an additional :german layer. All we need to do is
insert the new state ordering and change the red and yellow methods. They
should both return true, when the :red_and_yellow state is active.

    class TrafficLight
      in_layer :german do
        def state_ordering
          @state_ordering ||= [:red, :red_and_yellow, :green, :yellow]
        end

        def red
          (yield(:receiver).current == :red_and_yellow) or yield(:next)
        end
        def yellow 
          (yield(:receiver).current == :red_and_yellow) or yield(:next)
        end
      end
    end

    example do
      ContextR::with_layer :german do
        result_of($traffic_light.red) == true 

        $traffic_light.next
        result_of($traffic_light.red) == true 
        result_of($traffic_light.yellow) == true 

        $traffic_light.next
        result_of($traffic_light.green) == true 

        $traffic_light.next
        result_of($traffic_light.yellow) == true

        $traffic_light.next
        result_of($traffic_light.red) == true
      end
    end


Now we have a traffic light, that is able to work in the Netherlands and in 
Germany. But this is just the start. This example should show, that both
method modules and the base implementation may be changed at runtime and
the changes have immediate effect, just like they do in the basic ruby world.

In this example would like to change the textual representation a bit. I
think they do not give much information. Let's change extend them. 

    example do
      result_of($traffic_light.text) == "red"
      class TrafficLight
        # When running these test with ruby -w the following line will raise a 
        # warning, that you are discarding the old method definition. To avoid 
        # these simply undefine it before defining a new implementation.
        def text
          case @state
          when 0 : "It's red. Stop immediately."
          when 1 : "It's yellow. Prepare to start. It will be green soon."
          when 2 : "It's green. Hit it."
          when 3 : "It's yellow. Attention, it will be red soon. You better stop."
          end
        end
      end
      result_of($traffic_light.text) == "It's red. Stop immediately."
    end

Okay this works fine. But we also need to change it in case of the german
traffic light.

    example do
      # The old behaviour
      ContextR::with_layer :german do
        $traffic_light.next
        result_of($traffic_light.text) == 
                        "It's yellow. Prepare to start. It will be green soon."
      end

      # It's redefinition
      class TrafficLight
        in_layer :german do
          def text
            if yield(:receiver).current == :red_and_yellow
              "It's red and yellow at once. It will be green soon."
            else
              yield(:next)
            end
          end
        end
      end

      # The new behaviour
      ContextR::with_layer :german do
        result_of($traffic_light.text) == 
                          "It's red and yellow at once. It will be green soon."
      end
    end

One could argue, that we did not actually change the implementation, but just
added a method. Okay. Then let's change this method and translate the text.
This is a german traffic light, right?

    example do
      # The old behaviour
      ContextR::with_layer :german do
        result_of($traffic_light.text) == 
                          "It's red and yellow at once. It will be green soon."
      end

      class TrafficLight
        in_layer :german do
          # When running these test with ruby -w the following line will raise 
          # a warning, that you are discarding the old method definition. To 
          # avoid these simply undefine it before defining a new implementation.
          def text
            case yield(:receiver).current
            when :red : "Es ist rot. Anhalten."
            when :red_and_yellow : "Es ist gelb und rot gleichzeitig."
            when :green : "Grün. Gib Gas."
            when :yellow : "Das ist gelb. Gleich ist es rot. Halt lieber an."
            end
          end
        end
      end

      # The new behaviour
      ContextR::with_layer :german do
        result_of($traffic_light.text) == "Es ist gelb und rot gleichzeitig."
      end
    end

This was just a simple demonstration, that all the dynamics that are within
Ruby are still present, when you are using ContextR. No need to worry.
