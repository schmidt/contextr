This document tries to demonstrate the invocation order within 
context-specific method calls. There are two cases where this is relevant:
1. There is more than one layer active, that extends the method.
2. There is more than one module in a single layer that extends the method.

Unfortunately I could not find any relevant example that clearly demonstrates
this behaviour. Therefore I will use foo bar code. But I think it is still
easy to get the message.

I. Multiple active layers
-------------------------

Define the basis first.

    class OrderingTest
      def test_method 
        "base_method"
      end

      module FooMethods
        def test_method
          "foo_before #{yield(:next)} foo_after"
        end
      end
      module BarMethods
        def test_method
          "bar_before #{yield(:next)} bar_after"
        end
      end

      include FooMethods => :foo
      include BarMethods => :bar
    end

When multiple layers extend a single method, the order of activation 
determines the order of execution.

    example do
      instance = OrderingTest.new
      result_of(instance.test_method) == "base_method"

      ContextR::with_layer :foo do
        result_of(instance.test_method) == "foo_before base_method foo_after"
      end
      ContextR::with_layer :bar do
        result_of(instance.test_method) == "bar_before base_method bar_after"
      end

      ContextR::with_layer :bar, :foo do
        result_of(instance.test_method) == 
                        "bar_before foo_before base_method foo_after bar_after"
      end

      ContextR::with_layer :bar do
        ContextR::with_layer :foo do
          result_of(instance.test_method) == 
                        "bar_before foo_before base_method foo_after bar_after"
        end
      end

      ContextR::with_layer :foo, :bar do
        result_of(instance.test_method) == 
                        "foo_before bar_before base_method bar_after foo_after"
      end

      ContextR::with_layer :foo do
        ContextR::with_layer :bar do
          result_of(instance.test_method) == 
                        "foo_before bar_before base_method bar_after foo_after"
        end
      end
    end

As you can see, the innermost layer activation provides the innermost method
definition. It is not important, whether the layers were activated at once
or one after the other.

Activating and already active layer may update the execution order. The outer
activation is hidden, but is restored again after leaving the block.

    example do
      instance = OrderingTest.new

      ContextR::with_layer :bar, :foo do
        result_of(instance.test_method) == 
                        "bar_before foo_before base_method foo_after bar_after"

        ContextR::with_layer :bar do
          result_of(instance.test_method) == 
                        "foo_before bar_before base_method bar_after foo_after"
        end

        result_of(instance.test_method) == 
                        "bar_before foo_before base_method foo_after bar_after"
      end
    end


II. Multiple modules per layer and class
----------------------------------------

It is also possible to have more than one module define the context-dependent
behaviour of a class. In this case it may also happen, that multiple modules
extend the same method definition.

In this case we can reuse or already defined class and modules. This time
we include them into the same layer and see what happens.

    class OrderingTest
      include FooMethods => :foo_bar
      include BarMethods => :foo_bar
    end
     
    example do
      instance = OrderingTest.new
      result_of(instance.test_method) == "base_method"

      ContextR::with_layer :foo_bar do
        result_of(instance.test_method) == 
                        "bar_before foo_before base_method foo_after bar_after"
      end
    end

This time the last inclusion defines the outermost method. This can be again
changed. After repeating an inclusion the ordering is updated.

    example do
      class OrderingTest
        include FooMethods => :foo_bar
      end

      instance = OrderingTest.new
      result_of(instance.test_method) == "base_method"

      ContextR::with_layer :foo_bar do
        result_of(instance.test_method) == 
                        "foo_before bar_before base_method bar_after foo_after"
      end
    end

These should be all case where ordering matters. If you are aware of the
two basic rules, everything should work as expected. In an ideal world the
the execution order would not be important. But hey, this is not the ideal
world, so you better know.
