All documentation may be found in /test and /spec. The first contains written
english and some embedded usage examples, the latter a specification written in
RSpec.

This allows the documentation to be executable and testable. Therefore it is
more likely that is in sync with the current development of the libary. This
is all for your best.

So just have a look at the files in test and you will see what I mean.
